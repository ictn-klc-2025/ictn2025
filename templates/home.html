                <p class="font-weight-medium text-muted" style="text-align: justify;">The conference originated with the idea of celebrating the life and work of Padma Shri Professor Kasturi Lal Chopra, widely considered the pioneer of thin film research in India. He initiated basic and applied research in thin films and created technologies based on them which included three vital components: Knowledge, Leadership and Commercialization.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-medium text-muted" style="text-align: justify;">He nurtured young students to become dedicated scientists, leaders, and entrepreneurs for paying back to society through scientific discoveries, the development of pathbreaking technologies, and commercialization. Hence, the conference has been named to reflect this unique aspect (which also stands for the initials of his name, KLC) and as a step towards taking forward his legacy, there will be sessions dedicated to research ethics, leadership, and entrepreneurship targeted mainly for early career researchers. The conference will consist of plenary/invited talks and contributed papers on various focus areas in Thin Films & Nanotechnology. There will be dedicated poster sessions where Ph.D. students/researchers will have an opportunity to present their work to an international panel of experts and get feedback on their research ideas/results.</p>
